## how and why of this project

Our idea for this project was to create a scavenger hunt that would take participants to some of the best and most exciting places on campus because, in a post-pandemic world, people need a fun but safe way to explore the campus. 

We spent time brainstorming ideas such as which locations to use, how are we going to hint 
at them, and what else we could include. This is an example of the notes from one of our brainstorming sessions.


## Specific customization of AR content submitted
* is this in the interaction code? 
* is this in the concept?
* is this in the models? models are mostly custom made to hint at the locations people can expect the next hint
* is this in the experience?
* what is the expected experience: what should we see and where (if you have treasure/riddle content you may leave this out until after we test)
other ?
