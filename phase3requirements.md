# for the pdf file requirement for phase 3 
stuff from here will be copy pasted into a pdf when done

## Group Members and Contributions
* Amir - general idea of doing a scavenger hunt, made models (boat, burger, wendy’s)
* Elif - made and sourced models (cowboyace, shark), ar-camera code (testing), ideas for locations and hints
* Guy - icons for markers, art, posters, lore/stories on each location page, idea for the name of the project
* Prachi - website layout and interactions (general gh pages work), ar-camera code (final code + debugging), posters, ideas for locations and hints, pdf document, repository cleaning
* Vanessa - made markers, made QR codes, posters, models (bookshelf, central square)

## How and Why
Our idea for this project was to create a scavenger hunt that would take participants to some of the best and most exciting places on campus because, in a post-pandemic world, people need a fun but safe way to explore it. Moreover, for most of us, this was our first year on campus and we had to explore it on our own. We thought this hunt would be particularly perfect as the final project as the weather begins to get warmer and campus is more accessible to all. We wanted to give others the opportunity to explore in an amusing way, and who doesn’t love a good scavenger hunt?  

We spent time brainstorming ideas such as which locations to use, how are we going to hint 
at them, and what else we could include. Below is an example of the notes from one of our brainstorming sessions. While some of the models are more straightforward, some are more challenging. During a meeting with the professor, we realized that we to provide additional help for the users. Consequently, we decided to add a section for campus maps and some additional written hints on each location page.

Using the example code given to us in the course material, we decided to make this hunt marker-based rather than the hint showing up at a specific location before the user has a chance to explore the location for themselves. Additionally, most of the locations are in or around many buildings, therefore, location-based AR would be difficult to achieve. 
Specific customization of AR content
As aforementioned, the experience of this scavenger hunt is meant to draw attention to some lovely parts of the campus. Users are expected to scan the QR codes and markers to get hints for the next location until the end of the scavenger hunt. We decided to add interaction code, which means users can zoom in and out, and rotate the models/hints to get a better look. Furthermore, most of the models created were made by the group and are meant to be interesting. 

## Additional thoughts
It was really fun and interesting to work with AR for this project. We definitely want to add more to this project in the future. Some of us were thinking of adding sound elements, buttons within the AR scene and even adding more locations in the future
