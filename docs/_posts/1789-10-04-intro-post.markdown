We are the Pirates of the Seven(teen-twenty) Seas! weâ€™ve hidden some treasure somewhere on this campus!

think you could find it first??

read more how to find the treasure here.

click the button below and scan the square with the **anchor** on this poster to begin.
when you scan the image, you get your first hint for the next location! keep doing this until you get to the end.

look at the model carefully so you can find the right location.
use **two fingers** to zoom in and out and **one finger** to rotate the model.

happy hunting!!
