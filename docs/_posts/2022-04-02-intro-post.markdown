We are the Pirates of the Seven(teen-twenty) Seas! weâ€™ve hidden some treasure somewhere on this campus!

think you could find it first?

read more how to find the treasure below.

click the button below to open the special camera and scan the square with the **anchor** on this poster to begin.

when you scan the image, you get your a hint for the next location! keep doing this until you get to the end. scan the qr codes to get a fun story and an extra hint...

be sure to look at the model carefully so you can find the right location.

- use **two fingers** to zoom in and out and **one finger** to rotate the model.

be safe! happy hunting!!
