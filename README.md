#  Pirates of the Seven(teen-20) Seas (previously GroupPOV)
currently working on: making a github page + assets for our project (phase 2)

## technical and aesthetic thoughts
* We're working on making an AR scavenger hunt game.
  * we plan on adding QR codes to hidden parts of campus which would show the user a model that would be a hint to the next location.
* [phase 2 group documentation](https://harmless-ruby-a60.notion.site/group-project-documentation-phase-2-d4aa35fb870242a5b9160f7c49a32a6b)
