#  Pirates of the Seven(teen-20) Seas (previously GroupPOV)
[our website](https://robots-make-art-too.github.io/Group-Pirates/) -> code is in `gh-pages branch`

## the big idea
* we're working on making an AR scavenger hunt game.
  * we plan on adding "posters" to hidden parts of campus which would show the user a model that would be a hint to the next location.
  * we were also planning on incorporating location based AR and involving the existing public art/sculptures on campus
  * thinking of adding a leaderboard to see who finds the most things?
