#  Pirates of the Seven(teen-20) Seas 
[this is the main page of our website](https://robots-make-art-too.github.io/Group-Pirates/) -> code is in `gh-pages branch`

## the big idea 
see [this pdf](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/Group-Pirates/blob/main/group_pirates.pdf) for more
* we worked on creating an AR scavenger hunt game which would give the participant/user the opportunity to explore some fun parts of the York University Campus
  * we plan on adding "posters" to hidden parts of campus which would show the user a model that would be a hint to the next location.
