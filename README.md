# GROUP POV
currently working on: making a github page + assets for our project (phase 2)

## technical and aesthetic thoughts
* We would like to try something with 3rd person VR (live recording of a person at a distance & outputted into a VR headset they are wearing). The AR elements could possibly be interacted with like a game. We would like to speak with you (the prof) about details & what can be achieved.
* ~~[this] is a link to our (sorta) finalized idea~~
