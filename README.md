# 3. Technical & aesthetic initial thoughts
We would like to try something with 3rd person VR (live recording of a person at a distance & outputted into a VR headset they are wearing). The AR elements could possibly be interacted with like a game. We would like to speak with you (the prof) about details & what can be achieved.
